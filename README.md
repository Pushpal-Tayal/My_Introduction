# Pushpal Tayal- Projects Portfolio
##Index
This github accounts hold all my personal projects that I've done over the years. Currently they are organised in three different repositories:

1. Basic Python Projects:
2. GUI Projects:

Each repository is accompanied with a variety of projects and is accompanied with some form of documentation.

##Background

Hello!

My name is Pushpal Tayal and welcome to my github profile. A little bit about me. I work in management consulting and help businesses solve problems using my technical and non-technical skills. During the two years at my job, I have solved numerous probelms using coding. 

Now I focus on programming for whatever problem comes my way, automating the processes wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that interests me.

Ping me on tayalpushpal@gmail.com for collaborations.
